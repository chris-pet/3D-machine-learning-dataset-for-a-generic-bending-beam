# 3D-machine-learning-dataset-for-a-generic-bending-beam
In this data set, material is distributed randomly and contiguously in the design space in the form of a bending beam. 10,000 examples are generated and evaluated by a mechanical simulation. 

The data set should make it possible to read in an arbitrary material distribution in the form of a 3D array with a neural network and to have a corresponding evaluation of a simulation in the form of a table. This can then be used to train an NN that learns to recognise in the design space where material is important in the case of attacking forces and where it is not. 

The forces attack as shown in picture.
